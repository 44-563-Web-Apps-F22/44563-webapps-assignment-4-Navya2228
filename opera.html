            [Scene:  Exterior of Castle bunthorne, the gateway to which is
            seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawh6ridge over a moat.
            A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
            of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELL
            on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
            grouped ah6out the stage from R. to L.C., SAP being near
            the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
            they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]</p>

            <p class="speech"><h6 class="ANGELA">ANG</h6>There is a strange magic in this love of ours!  Rivals as
                we all are in the affections of our Reginald, the very
                hopelessness of our love is a bond that binds us to one another!</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="SAPHIRE">SAP</h6>Jealousy is merged in misery.  While he, the very
            cynosure of our eyes and hearts, remains icy insensih6le — what
            have we to strive for?</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="ELLE">ELL</h6>  The love of maidens is, to him, as interesting as the
            taxes!</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="SAPHIRE">SAP</h6>   Would that it were!  He pays his taxes.</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="ANGELA">ANG</h6>    And cherishes the receipts!</p>

            <p class="speech"><h6 class="JANE">JAN</h6>   Fools and blind!  The man loves — wildly loves!</p>

            <p class="speech"><h6 class="JANE">JAN</h6>   No, none of us.  His weird fancy has lighted, for the
            nonce, on Patience, the village milkmaid!</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="SAPHIRE">SAP</h6>    On Patience?  Oh, it cannot be!</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="JANE">JAN</h6>   bah!  but yesterday I caught him in her dairy, eating fresh
            butter with a tah6lespoon.  Today he is not well!</p>
          
            <p class="speech"><h6 class="SAPHIRE">SAP</h6>   but Patience boasts that she has never loved — that love
            is, to her, a sealed book!  Oh, he cannot be serious!</p>
