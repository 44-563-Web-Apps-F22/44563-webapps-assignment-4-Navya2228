            [Scene:  Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
            seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
            A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
            of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
            on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
            grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
            the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
            they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]</p>
            <br>
                      No. 1. Twenty love-sick maidens we
                          <p style="color:red">(Opening Chorus and Solos)</p>
            <br>
                          Maidens, Angela, and Ella
            <br></br>          

     
            <b>ANGELA </b> There is a strange magic in this love of ours!  Rivals as
            we all are in the affections of our Reginald, the very
            hopelessness of our love is a bond that binds us to one another!<br>
          
            <b>SAPHIR</b> Jealousy is merged in misery.  While he, the very
            cynosure of our eyes and hearts, remains icy insensible — what
            have we to strive for?<br>
          
            <b>ELLA</b> The love of maidens is, to him, as interesting as the
            taxes!<br>
          
            <b>SAPHIR</b>  Would that it were!  He pays his taxes.<br>
          
            <b>ANGELA</b>  And cherishes the receipts!<br>
          
            [Enter LADY JANE, L.U.E.]<br>
          
            <b>SAPHIR</b>  Happy receipts!  [All sigh heavily]<br>
          
            <b>JANE </b>[L.C., suddenly] Fools!  [They start, and turn to her]<br>
          
            <b>ANGELA</b> I beg your pardon?<br>
          
            <b>JANE</b>  Fools and blind!  The man loves — wildly loves!<br>
          
            <b>ANGELA</b>  But whom?  None of us!<br>
          
            <b>JANE</b>  No, none of us.  His weird fancy has lighted, for the
            nonce, on Patience, the village milkmaid!<br>
          
            <b>SAPHIR</b>  On Patience?  Oh, it cannot be!<br>
          
            <b>JANE</b>  Bah!  But yesterday I caught him in her dairy, eating fresh
            butter with a tablespoon.  Today he is not well!<br>
          
            <b>SAPHIR</b> But Patience boasts that she has never loved — that love
            is, to her, a sealed book!  Oh, he cannot be serious!<br>
